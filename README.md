This project is a Python-based cache simulator that models the behavior of a cache memory system, supporting both direct-mapped and set-associative architectures using a Least Recently Used (LRU) replacement policy.
The simulator allows users to configure key cache parameters such as cache size, block size, associativity, number of memory accesses, and memory address range.
It simulates random memory accesses and tracks the number of cache hits and misses to analyze the performance of different cache configurations.
The script outputs the cache hit rate for each tested cache size and visualizes the results in a bar chart using Matplotlib.
This project is useful for students and professionals who want to understand how cache design parameters affect performance in computer architecture.
The code is easy to modify and extend, making it a great tool for educational and experimental purposes.
